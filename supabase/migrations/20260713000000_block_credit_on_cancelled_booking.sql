-- Bug fix: a diver applied open account credit toward the balance of a
-- CANCELLED booking (an event cancelled ~2 months earlier). A cancelled
-- booking still carries its frozen `details.total`, so the RPC computed a
-- positive "balance due" and drew the credit down into a dead booking —
-- silently destroying spendable credit that can never be recovered from a
-- booking the diver will never attend.
--
-- The diver and admin UIs already hide cancelled bookings from every
-- apply-credit surface, but apply_credit_to_booking is SECURITY DEFINER and
-- the sole path a diver can write credits/payments, so the guard has to live
-- here to be authoritative for every caller (incl. a stale client acting on a
-- booking that was cancelled after the page loaded, and admin registrant
-- cards that list cancelled divers).
--
-- Only the cancelled check is added; the rest of the body is unchanged.
